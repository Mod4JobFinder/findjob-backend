        world changed in 2020.**BREAK** **BREAK** Companies across the globe had to
        figure out how to complete their workflows in a completely remote environment.
        For sales teams selling complex products, this was an especially difficult
        challenge due to the collaborative nature of high-performing sales teams.**BREAK**
        **BREAK** Luckily, we at Demoflow had already been building a gamechanging
        platform to redefine the way remote teams sell together. We have created a
        live sales workspace paired with Zoom to provide an amazing environment and
        experience to all remote sales professionals and their customers.**BREAK**
        **BREAK** We quickly raised a seed round investment from prominent VC firms
        and companies including the Slack Fund, and we''ve spent the last year hitting
        the market quickly. Accordingly, we are building an incredible team of high-performing
        individuals who are ready to build a category-defining platform for this new
        remote selling economy.**BREAK** **BREAK** Our company culture is driven by
        a value-based framework where our clients'' success is ultimately our success.
        We foster employee growth and development, and always strive to promote from
        within. What do we expect in return? A partner who is willing to give it their
        all in our fast-moving, ever-evolving, recently funded startup.**BREAK** **BREAK**
        You will ACTUALLY have a direct impact on the success of our company. The
        work you do today will help build the foundation of (y)our team in the near
        future. Also, we like hiking, motorcycles, skydiving, movies, memes, and much
        more. You don''t have to like those things too, but we encourage you to be
        interesting.**BREAK** **BREAK** Senior Full Stack Engineer**BREAK** **BREAK**
        As a senior Full Stack Engineer you will design, develop, and deploy large,
        integral parts of the application. We have a pipeline of features that span
        all areas of the tech stack, so you should be excited about the possibility
        of having a big impact on the product. Ideally, you have experience running
        development processes and/or managing development teams. That won''t be required
        immediately, but would be a big nice-to-have as we scale.**BREAK** **BREAK**
        The role is ideal for an engineer with strong attention to detail and a high
        bar for quality. Demoflow users run demos worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
        to their companies, so bugs and crashes in critical workflows are not acceptable.
        Accordingly, the engineer should have experience with test-driven development
        and modern testing tools. This engineer will not only have the opportunity
        to build new product features, but also have the opportunity to help build
        an engineering team and mentor newer engineers in the future.**BREAK** **BREAK**

        and community support. We care deeply about developer happiness, productivity,
        and experience .We are heavily investing in Elixir, an amazing functional

        important decisions everyday and must feel they have the right amount of information
